# Earthquake & Tsunami Risk Analysis (Python)

## Project Overview

Exploratory analysis of global earthquake data to understand patterns associated with tsunami occurrences using magnitude, depth, time, and location.

## Tools Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights

High magnitude alone does not guarantee tsunami occurrence

Tsunami-generating earthquakes tend to occur at shallower depths

Tsunami events are relatively rare but spike in certain years

Tsunami-related earthquakes show geographic clustering
